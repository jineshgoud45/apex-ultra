Task Decomposer Agent Plugin
---------------------------
This is a sample task decomposer agent for the APEX-ULTRAâ„¢ plugin marketplace.
It can be dynamically loaded/unloaded at runtime via the orchestrator API.
When registered, it simulates receiving a high-level goal and decomposing it into actionable tasks.
