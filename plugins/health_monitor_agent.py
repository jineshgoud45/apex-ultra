Health Monitor Agent Plugin
--------------------------
This is a sample health monitor agent for the APEX-ULTRAâ„¢ plugin marketplace.
It can be dynamically loaded/unloaded at runtime via the orchestrator API.
When registered, it checks the health/status of all loaded agents/plugins and prints a report.
