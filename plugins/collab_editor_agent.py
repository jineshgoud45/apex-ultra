Collaborative Editor Agent Plugin
--------------------------------
This is a sample collaborative editor agent for the APEX-ULTRAâ„¢ plugin marketplace.
It can be dynamically loaded/unloaded at runtime via the orchestrator API.
When registered, it simulates initializing a collaborative editor session and demonstrates multi-user awareness.
