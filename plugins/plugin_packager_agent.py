Plugin Packager Agent Plugin
---------------------------
This is a sample plugin packager agent for the APEX-ULTRAâ„¢ plugin marketplace.
It can be dynamically loaded/unloaded at runtime via the orchestrator API.
When registered, it simulates packaging a plugin (zipping files, adding metadata) and prints the steps.
