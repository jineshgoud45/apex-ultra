Parallel Agent Tree Plugin
-------------------------
This is a sample parallel agent tree for the APEX-ULTRAâ„¢ plugin marketplace.
It can be dynamically loaded/unloaded at runtime via the orchestrator API.
When registered, it simulates initializing a tree of parallel agents (actor model), distributes tasks, and prints the execution flow.
